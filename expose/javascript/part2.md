# Part 2 questions

## First question
The number three would be printed since i is a var type which means its value can be accessed globally. Last value of i would be a 3 since that is the first time during its incrementation, where the variable breaks the for-loop rule.

## Second question
The number 150 would be printed since discountedPrice variable is global and its last value, before for-loop is terminated, is 150.

## Third question
This would also return 150 since finalPrice is a global variable and its last value was 150 before for-loop was terminated.

## Fourth question
It would print nothing since there is no print statement.

## Fifth question
It would be an error since i is limited to the scope of the for-loop.

## Sixth question
It would be an error since variable discountedPrice is limited to scope of for-loop.

## Seventh question
It would print out 150 since this line is part of the scope which variable finalPrice is also part off

## Eighth question
It would print nothing since there is no print statement.

## Ninth question
This would lead to an error since variable is limited to scope of for-loop which the line in question is not part off.

## Tenth question
It would print out 3 since this line is in the scope which variable length is also part off and value of length has not change.

## Eleventh question
Nothing would be printed out due to the fact that there exists NO print statements.

## Twelfth question
### A
alert(student["name"]);

### B
alert(student["Grad Year"]);

### C
student.greeting();

### D
alert(student["Grad Year"]["Name"]);

### D
alert(student["Grad Year"]["Name"]);

### E
alert(student.courseLoad[0]);

## Thirteenth question
### A
32 is printed out. [3 is concatenated with 2, giving 32]

### B
1 is printed out. [3 is converted to int. So, 3 minus 2 is a 1]

### C 
3 is printed out. [null is converted into a zero and 3 plus 0 is done]

### D
3null is printed out. [null is converted into a string object and concatenated with 3]

### E
4 is printed out.[True converts to 1, and then calculation becomes 1 plus 3]

### F
0 is printed out.[Null and false are both converted to 0, and then calculation become 0 plus 0.]

### G
3undefined is printed out.[undefined becomes a string object and is concatenated with string object 3.]

### H
NaN is printed out.[Undefined when converted to an integer becomes NaN and 3 is converted to an integer. 3 minus NaN can only be NaN]

## Fourteenth question
### A
True is printed out. [String 2 become number 2]

### B
False is printed out. [The string are compared lexicographically, means that 2 is compared to 1 instead of 12]

### C 
True is printed out. [String 2 is converted into integer 2]

### D
False is printed out. [Objects are of different types.]

### E
False is printed out.[True converts to 1, and then calculation becomes 1 is not equal to 2.]

### F
True is printed out.[2 is converted to boolean and when converted it equates to true and expression changes to 'true == true']

## Fifteenth question
=== checks for equality without type conversion, unlike ==.

## Seventeenth question
While nothing would be printed out, the function would return array [2,4,6]. This is because in the modifyArray, a new array is created and there exists a for-loop in the method which fills in the new array with double the values of the array inputed into the modifyArray method.
