# Part 2 questions

## First question
The number three would be printed since i is a var type which means its value can be accessed globally. Last value of i would be a 3 since that is the first time during its incrementation, where the variable breaks the for-loop rule.

## Second question
The number 150 would be printed since discountedPrice variable is global and its last value, before for-loop is terminated, is 150.

## Third question
This would also return 150 since finalPrice is a global variable and its last value was 150 before for-loop was terminated.

## Fourth question
It would print nothing since there is no print statement.

## Fifth question
It would be an error since i is limited to the scope of the for-loop.

## Sixth question
It would be an error since variable discountedPrice is limited to scope of for-loop.

## Seventh question
It would print out 150 since this line is part of the scope which variable finalPrice is also part off

## Eighth question
It would print nothing since there is no print statement.

## Ninth question
This would lead to an error since variable is limited to scope of for-loop which the line in question is not part off.

## Tenth question
It would print out 3 since this line is in the scope which variable length is also part off and value of length has not change.

## Eleventh question
Nothing would be printed out due to the fact that there exists NO print statements.
